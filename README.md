# marketing-data-project

This data project is based on a data-set that contains real data from a company called **Olist** which is a virtual market place in Brazil. 

In this data set we can see the whole process, it includes the top of the funnel as well as the bottom of the funnel. Since the lead is first being contacted until the lead is won.

The 4 business questions I want to answer with this data set are the following:
  1. Which marketing origins produce the highest conversion rate to closed deals?
  2. How long does it take for a lead to move from first contact to deal won on average (by origin)?
  3. Which SDRs or SRs close the most deals, and do they specialize in certain business segments?
  4. Do certain lead behaviour profiles (cat, wolf, eagle, etc.) lead to higher deal values or quicker closes?

The plan for the week:

Monday - Dataset understanding and questions
  - Select the data, explore it and see what is the key information I need to use for each question.
  - Start cleaning the data and removing all unnecessary information.
  - Merge datasets
  - Create GitHub repo and upload all the csv's, and jupyter notebook with the necessary info.

Tuesday - Data Cleaning & Wrangling
  - Handle missing values:
      - declared_monthly_revenue, average_stock, has_gtin
  - Create new calculated fields such as conversion_rate, days_to_close
